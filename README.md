# To-Do List Application 
This is a simple to-do list application that uses react-router-dom to page redirect after user login. 

## Still to be finished
Eventually, I would like to implement a database with password hashing for proof of concept. The to-do list lets you add items and then clear the list. It doesn't allow you to delete individual items but that feature may come sometime in the future.
### Current State Demonstration
